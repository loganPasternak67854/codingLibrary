function[hzFrequency]=peakHeightANDpeakFrequency()
%{
Converts ROI trace data from time domain to frequency domain and displays
graph of flourescence vs frequency. Presents the peak values of the
trace data in terms of height and frequency. Half height is also displayed
graphically. (AUTHOR'S NOTE: Need to find way to display half height as an
array. Command window also spews output stuff. Need to suppress output.)
